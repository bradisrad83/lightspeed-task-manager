## Brad's Coding Challenge 

# Instructions 
1. clone repo
2. cd into repo
3. composer install
4. php artisan key:generate
5. copy env.example into a new .env file
6. update local DB information
7. php artisan migrate --seed

*Notes:  I think all of the requirements are meant to give you an idea of my programming skills and level.  I feel like I could spend some more time on it but at this point I also know that you would probably like to see some code examples.  I hope you enjoy and look forward to hearing some feedback.
